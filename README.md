# SENG 438 – Assignment 2  
## Requirements-Based Test Generation

This assignment focuses on applying **requirements-based (black-box) testing techniques** to real-world software components. Students design and implement unit tests for selected classes from the **JFreeChart** library based solely on their **Javadoc API specifications**, without referencing source code implementations.

The assignment emphasizes systematic **test planning**, **test-case design**, and **test execution**. Test cases are derived using formal black-box techniques such as **equivalence class partitioning** and **boundary value analysis** to ensure adequate coverage of functional requirements.

All tests are implemented using **JUnit 5**, reinforcing best practices in automated unit testing, traceability from requirements to tests, and disciplined software quality assurance.
